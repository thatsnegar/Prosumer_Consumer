- 100 prosumers (some can be consumers, some pv owners)

- at least 24 time steps : 24 h

- at each time steps each prosumer goes through 3 levels :

    1. self-balancing => use own pv/storage/load shifting to reduce own imbalance 

    2. Self-Organized negotiation(P2P trading)  => trade remaining surplus/deficit with other prosumers

    3. Local market via load aggregator  => whatever is still not balanced goes to a local market (central clearing)
    and finally to the utility/Grid if still needed

REGULATOR :
- controller that sets rules to push the community toward some objective, like:
    -- maximize total community profile,Or
    -- maximize renewable usage 
    -- maximize amount of self-Organized trading 
    -- even create chaos 

BLOCKCHAIN:
- Every agreed transaction is recorded on a simple blockchain :
    -- At least 10 miners/validators 
    -- We choose POW(e.g: hash starts with "000") or POS 

- Using course blocks we already have :
    -- PV generation => forecast roof-top PV output per prosumer 
    -- Price Forecast => forecast of external grid price/wholesale price
    -- Prosumer Community => agent behaviors, bakancing rules 
    -- Blockchain Support => mining, consensus, transaction loggin


FINAL DELIVERY :
- less than 10 slides :
    -- community assumption 
    -- mathematical models
    -- simulation result 
    -- discussion 
    -- conclusion
